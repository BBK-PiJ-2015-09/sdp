## Assignment Two - Virtual Machine

### Spring Term - 2017

#### Team members:
- Harry Wright
- Alex Rudall

#### About
The purpose of this project is to complete the 
implementation of a stack-based virtual machine 
that executes a small set of “bytecode” instructions. 
Just like the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that executes 
JVM bytecode (the representation your Scala/Java 
programs are compiled to), the virtual machine 
that you implement will execute a small set of 
bytecode instructions represented as textual 
commands that manipulate the state of a virtual machine. 
These commands/instructions perform operations 
on a stack-based virtual machine to 
execute simple computations. 

#### Testing
Unit testing was implemented in ScalaTest.
The provided tests were extended upon to improve
coverage.
